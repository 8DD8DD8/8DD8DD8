Hi I'm dd_8, 
And if your reading this...
I'm already dead.

(Just kidding)

I’m dd_8 (@8DD8DD8),
I'm your average person who dabbles in a bit of everything.
So far I'm trying to learn Python and Node.js
I like to talk about robots, AI, Aviation, Blender, Minecraft, Games, How stuff works and pretty much everything else.
If you ever think you need something from me my discord is dd_8#5028
